## Overview
### Description
Trippy is a mobile iOS app that allows users to pin and save different types of locations around their city, generate personalized travel itineraries, and share their favorite sights with others. The goal is to become a one-stop shop for conceptualizing, planning, and carrying out local outings with friends. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** This app belongs to the Travel and Social categories.
- **Mobile:** Great in mobile form, as map features and real-time location updates are key for the app's features
- **Story:** Many of my friends and peers travel to new places often for school and internships, so this product would have a lot use for them.
- **Market:** The market for this app is extensive â€“ while it might be most compelling for younger users with frequent outings, anyone with an interest in travel would have use for this app.
- **Habit:** Most users would only need the app a few times a month, but would likely be engaged in both consuming and creating.
- **Scope:** While a full app is beyond the scope of this program, it may be possible to implement basic features for one area (ie. downtown Seattle).
